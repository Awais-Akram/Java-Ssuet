Example: No. is 2  
Expected Output:
Square : 4 , Cube : 8 , Fourth : 16 

Question 3
Write a Java program to compare two numbers.
Input Data:
Input first integer: 25
Input second integer: 39
Expected Output:
25 != 39                                                                          
25 < 39                                                                           
25 <= 39

Question 5
Take an employee’s number of years of experience and their age and decide how much raise should be given to them in their salary. The condition is that if an employee’s experience is less than 3 years and his age is less than 40, he gets 20% raise, if their experience is less than 5 years and their age is less than 40, they get 30%, and if their experience is more than 7 years and their age is more than 40, they get 50% raise.
Hint:
Define two variables one for int yearsExperience , int age

Question 6
Write a Java program to display multiplication table of 8 upto 5.

Question 7
Write a program in Java to display the pattern like right angle triangle with a number.
Input number is: No of Rows = 5
Hint : Use for loop / do-while
Expected output:
1

123                                                                              
1234                                                                             
12345                                                                                                                                                     

Question 8
Write a program in Java to display the first 10 natural numbers using do-while.

Question 9
Write code to achieve given output:
Initialize int a  = 20 , int b = 10;
If a is not equal to 10 print “a is not equal to 10”.
Either a is greater than 10 or b is greater than 10 print “Either a or b  is greater than 10”

Question 10
Write a program to swap variable’s value. 
Hint : Use temporary variable to swap values.
Initialize:  int a  = 20 , int b = 10;
Expected output: b = 20 , a = 10
